            <ul>
                <li> Medicare is a federal public health insurance program in the U.S. that serves adults who are older than 65 or who are younger than 65 and have a disability. </li>
                <li> Medicare is the <a href = "https://www.cms.gov/cms-guide-medical-technology-companies-and-other-interested-parties/payment">largest</a> health insurer in the U.S., paying <a href = "https://www.cms.gov/cms-guide-medical-technology-companies-and-other-interested-parties/payment">billions</a> to hospitals and other health care providers each year. </li>
                <li> These activities are funded by <a href = "https://www.medicare.gov/about-us/how-is-medicare-funded">payroll taxes</a>. </li>

        <ul>
            <li> The Deep South and Appalachia have higher concentrations of beneficiaries with disabilities and correspondingly beneficiaries less than 65, with Arkansas leading at 19.2%. These areas also report elevated rates of <a href="https://nccd.cdc.gov/ckd/detail.aspx?Qnum=Q705">chronic kidney disease</a>, highlighting regional health challenges. </li>
            <li> There is a higher proportion of Black beneficiaries in the South, including states like Mississippi, Louisiana, and Georgia. The highest concentration reaches 32% in Mississippi, which happens to be the state with the <a href="https://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/blackafrican-american-health#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20U.S.%20Census,of%20the%20total%20U.S.%20population%20">highest Black population</a>. </li>
            <li> In a similar reflection of national census data, most Hispanic-identifying beneficiaries live the southwest. The proportion of Hispanic respondents tops out at 32% in New Mexico; similar proportions are seen in neighboring states.</li>
            <li> The survey gender ratio is roughly 85 men for 100 women, slightly outpacing the national gender ratio (~50%) and reflecting women’s <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7228a5.htm">longer life expectancy</a>. </li>

        <h3> What is supplemental insurance? </h3>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li> Because Medicare does not cover all healthcare costs, most beneficiaries have <b>supplemental insurance</b>: one or more of <b class = "medicaid_text"> Medicaid</b>, <b class = "medicare_advantage_text"> Medicare Advantage</b>, <b class = "part_d_text"> Part D</b>, and <b class = "private_insurance_text" > private insurance. </b> </li>
            <li> Though eligibility varies by state, beneficiaries are also eligible for <b class = "medicaid_text">Medicaid</b> if they make lower incomes. These "dual-eligibles" often face many compounding <a href = "https://www.who.int/health-topics/social-determinants-of-health"> social risk factors</a> that impact their health; for this reason, many public health interventions focus on this group. </li>
            <li> For additional benefits like vision insurance, dental insurance, and/or care coordination, beneficiaries can opt for a privately-administered <b class = "medicare_advantage_text">Medicare Advantage plan</b>. (Trump and others in his party want to <a href = "https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5183092/trump-election-2024-medicare-advantage"> expand Medicare Advantage</a>, though these plans are <a href = "https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5183092/trump-election-2024-medicare-advantage"> costlier</a> and often provide <a href = "https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5183092/trump-election-2024-medicare-advantage"> fewer services</a>.) </li>
            <li> Due to <a href = https://www.rand.org/news/press/2024/02/01.html>unmanageably high</a> prescription drug costs, <a href = "https://data.cms.gov/summary-statistics-on-beneficiary-enrollment/medicare-and-medicaid-reports/medicare-monthly-enrollment"> 80.4%</a> of beneficiaries also enroll in <b class = "part_d_text">Part D</b> insurance for assistance with this. </li>
            <li> Finally, beneficiaries who still receive insurance from an employer are additionally <b class = "private_insurance_text">privately insured</b>.</li>

            <h3> What are our main findings? </h3>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li> Medicare beneficiaries are geographically, demographically, and financially diverse. </li>
                <li> People of color are more likely to face chronic health conditions and least likely to receive satisfactory services. </li>
                <li> There are also demographic differences in supplemental insurance and out-of-pocket costs that systematically disenfranchise minority beneficiaries. </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3> What is our key takeaway? </h3>
        <br>
        <div style = "font-size: 30px"> The geographic, demographic, and financial diversity of Medicare beneficiaries is critical to recognize and prioritize when making policy decisions.
            Only by understanding and addressing these differences can we achieve equitable access to high-quality health care and improve Medicare for all. </div>
