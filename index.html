        <h2> Who is eligible for Medicare? </h2>
        <div> Medicare is primarily available for people who are aged 65 or older. Provided that they are eligible for Social Security benefits, people
            with disabilities, permanent kidney failure, or ALS may be able to enroll for Medicare before they turn 65. We invite you to explore our interactive
            map to observe the geographic trends of Medicare eligibility. In America's Deep South and Appalachia regions, there is a higher concentration
            of people with disabilities who are Medicare beneficiaries, with Arkansas having the highest proportion at 19.2%. These areas also experience
            the highest amount of Chronic Kidney Disease according to the
            <a href="https://nccd.cdc.gov/ckd/detail.aspx?Qnum=Q705">U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</a> Similar to the concentration of
            Medicare beneficiaries who have disabilities in the Deep South and Appalachia regions, most people younger than 65 years old who receive Medicare
            live here as well.

        <div>
            Building on the demographics of Medicare beneficiaries and their supplemental insurance coverage, the bar chart delves into the financial burden faced by beneficiaries in terms of out-of-pocket healthcare costs. The majority of beneficiaries experience relatively low out-of-pocket expenses, with the highest frequency concentrated in the lowest cost category. However, as costs increase, the number of beneficiaries sharply declines, revealing a small but significant group incurring expenses above $10,000. This highlights the uneven distribution of financial responsibility among Medicare beneficiaries, where a vulnerable minority bears disproportionately higher costs.

        <div>
            Expanding on the distribution of out-of-pocket expenses, the scatter plot provides additional context by examining the relationship between total healthcare payments and out-of-pocket costs, segmented by income group (<$25,000 and ≥$25,000). While higher total payments often correlate with increased out-of-pocket expenses, the data also uncovers income-based disparities:
            <ul>
                <li>Lower-income beneficiaries are concentrated in the lower payment ranges yet still face considerable variability in out-of-pocket costs.</li>
                <li>Higher-income beneficiaries are more evenly distributed across the payment spectrum, with outliers incurring exceptionally high total payments and out-of-pocket costs.</li>
            </ul>
            These patterns underscore the challenges faced by lower-income individuals, who may be disproportionately burdened despite their lower total payments.
